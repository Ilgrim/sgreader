SGReader
========

History
-------

This program was original written by Pecunia (http://pecunia.nerdcamp.net/).
I'm placing it here so that should the various places that currently host a copy
of the source code disappear, the world will still be able to extract SG files.

Use
---

SG files refer to the data files of the City Building games, i.e. Zeus,
Caesar 3, and such like. SGreader will extract sg3 and sg2 files.

Build
-----

    qmake
    make
    ./sgreader
    # or
    sudo make install

If you want to build the original SGReader without any modifications, checkout
the git tag "pecunia".
